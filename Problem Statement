Problem Statement: Enhanced Dashboard Design for Loan Data Analysis

Objective: Our goal is to develop a series of interconnected dashboards that offer a dynamic and detailed analysis of our loan data to empower decision-making through data-driven insights. These dashboards are designed to provide a comprehensive view of our lending activities, borrower profiles, loan performance, and financial health metrics.

Dashboard 1: Summary Insights

Purpose: To provide a snapshot of key performance indicators (KPIs) critical for evaluating the overall effectiveness and health of our lending operations.

Key Features:

- Total Loan Applications: Monitor the total and Month-to-Date (MTD) applications, analyzing trends and changes Month-over-Month (MoM).
- Total Funded Amount: Assess the total funds disbursed and keep track of MTD disbursements and MoM variations to understand funding trends.
- Total Amount Received: Evaluate cash flow through total and MTD amounts received from borrowers, noting MoM fluctuations for financial health assessment.
- Average Interest Rate: Gauge the cost of lending by calculating and tracking the average interest rate of all loans, including MTD and MoM changes.
- Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Determine borrowers' financial stability by computing the average DTI for all loans and monitoring MTD and MoM changes.

Loan Performance Analysis:

- Distinguish between "Good" and "Bad" loans using specific KPIs such as application percentages, funded amounts, and received amounts.
- Implement a "Loan Status Grid View" for a detailed categorization by loan status, offering insights into various metrics and facilitating data-driven decision-making.

Dashboard 2: Overview & Trends

Purpose: To visualize lending trends, borrower demographics, and loan purposes through interactive charts, aiding in the identification of patterns and opportunities.

Key Visualizations:

- Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart): Explore seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.
- Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map): Highlight significant lending regions and analyze geographical disparities.
- Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): Understand the distribution of loans across different terms.
- Employment Length Analysis (Bar Chart): Assess the impact of employment history on lending metrics.
- **Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart):** Visualize the reasons borrowers seek financing.
- **Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map):** Examine the influence of home ownership on loan applications and disbursements.

Dashboard 3: Detailed Insights

Purpose: To offer a granular view of loan data, providing users with a comprehensive and efficient way to access key metrics and details about loans, borrowers, and loan performance.

Objective: The "Details Dashboard" aims to be a user-friendly platform offering a one-stop solution for in-depth analysis of the loan portfolio, enhancing our ability to make informed lending decisions.

Implementation Strategy:

- Develop each dashboard with a clear, intuitive layout to facilitate easy navigation and interaction.
- Ensure real-time data integration for up-to-date analysis and decision-making.
- Employ user feedback loops to continually refine and enhance dashboard functionalities.

By achieving these objectives, we aim to enhance our lending strategies, optimize financial health, and improve borrower satisfaction through insightful data analysis and strategic dashboard design.
